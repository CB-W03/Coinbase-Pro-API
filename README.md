# Coinbase-Pro-API
This is a small project using the coinbase PRO sanbox API
it allows one to buy crypto (Sandbox so it's not real money however would work on original)
check your account history and use websockets to diasplay trades in terminal
hoping to add more functionality to display data on a chart. 
However this small project taught me how APIs can have many uses
and how useful they are.
